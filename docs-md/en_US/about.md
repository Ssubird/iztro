# About the Author


## Who Am I‚ùì

I am a web developer who has been deeply involved in web development for many years and has a wide range of hobbies. I love coding and enjoy researching all sorts of unusual things. I have been studying Ziwei Dou Shu for several years. I have no mentor and do not belong to any school of thought.


## Where Am I‚ùì

I am currently based in a city where once you come, you can't leave ‚Äî Chengdu, Sichuan, China. If there are like-minded individuals in the same location, we can meet for tea and exchange ideas. I am someone who loves making friends and hopes to be friends with people from all over the world.


## What Am I Doing‚ùì

I used to be a full-stack developer, but now I mainly focus on front-end development.

## Why Open Source‚ùì

Many years ago, based on my experience in reading charts and accumulated knowledge, I developed a web application for Ziwei Dou Shu charting (because the ones available on the market were not very user-friendly üòù). As I gradually improved it for my own use, it evolved into a relatively stable version. After finding it very convenient to use, I decided to open source it, providing it for free to enthusiasts of Ziwei Dou Shu or professional practitioners in the field of fortune-telling. On one hand, it is to contribute to the dissemination of traditional culture, and on the other hand, it is a summary and consolidation of what I have learned.

if you find it useful, please give me some encouragement, so I can have the motivation to keep going.
